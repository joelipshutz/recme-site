          Block an account immediately when you need separation. Use the
          in-app Report action for abusive content or behavior so the safety
          team receives the relevant private evidence. If the Report action is
          unavailable, email{" "}
          <a href={`mailto:${SUPPORT_EMAIL}?subject=rec.me%20safety%20report`}>
            {SUPPORT_EMAIL}
          </a>{" "}
          with “Safety report” in the subject and include the profile or
          content involved. Do not forward private notes or precise location.
          For immediate danger, contact local emergency services.

          If sign-in, sync, or imports are temporarily unavailable, keep rec.me
          installed and avoid repeatedly recreating the same item. Local saves
          and drafts are designed to retry when the connection recovers.
