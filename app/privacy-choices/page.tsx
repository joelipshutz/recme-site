        <p>
          In Profile → Settings → Privacy and trust, you can enable Private
          Profile and choose whether new saves start in Stealth. You can also
          change visibility while saving or editing a place.

        <h2>Block or mute someone</h2>
        <p>
          Use the options on a member profile, then manage your blocked and
          muted accounts in Profile → Settings → Blocked and muted accounts.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Permissions and notifications</h2>
        <p>
          Change location, photo, camera, contact, and notification permission
          in iOS Settings. Manage rec.me notification categories under Profile
          → Settings → Notifications.

        <h2>Delete your account</h2>
        <p>
          Open Profile → Settings → Delete my account. After two confirmations,
          rec.me requests permanent deletion of the account, owned records,
          stored media, and notification registrations. If deletion fails, the
          app tells you that nothing was removed so you can retry safely.

      <section>
        <h2>Access, correction, export, or deletion request</h2>
        <p>
          Email <a href={`mailto:${SUPPORT_EMAIL}`}>{SUPPORT_EMAIL}</a> from the
          address connected to your account. Include the type of request and
          your rec.me username. Do not include passwords, authentication codes,
          private notes, or precise location in the message.

          We may ask for reasonable verification. Applicable privacy rights
          vary by location. We do not discriminate against people for making a
